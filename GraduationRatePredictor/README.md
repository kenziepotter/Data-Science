# Graduation Rate Predictor

The aim of this project is to model the way government expenditures and labor appropriation impacts secondary education graduation rates in New York State Public Schools. Our experiments show that diminishing returns are not present in funding, rather the educational staffâ€™s quality affects graduation rates. Our highest performing model predicted graduation rate SVR with a median squared error of 3.863.
